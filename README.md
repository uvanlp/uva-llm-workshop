## Goals

Large language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems that excel in comprehending and generating human languages and programming languages. They utilize deep learning techniques to achieve unprecedented scale and complexity in language processing. Prominent examples of LLMs are OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude. They find applications in intelligent educational tools, offering personalized tutoring and answering questions across various subjects. Moreover, LLMs have potential applications in scientific research by summarizing scientific discovery, extracting key information, and even deriving research plans.

**The goal of this workshop is to bring together students, researchers, and faculty from across UVA to exchange ideas, foster collaboration, and explore innovative applications of LLMs in engineering, education, and scientific research.** We aim to create a vibrant community where participants can share their experiences, learn from each other, and discover new opportunities for leveraging LLMs in their respective domains.
